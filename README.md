# chess-pawn-game-ai-multiplayer
An in-progress Python project simulating a chess-inspired pawn game with an AI opponent (using minimax with iterative deepening and alpha–beta pruning), a Pygame GUI, and socket-based multiplayer via a client–server model. Future work includes refining the AI and expanding features.
